# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview:
I received constructive feedback for my PlanMyTrip app from Jack and Beta Testers. They pointed out areas of improvement to make my app a commercial success such as:
* Using input statements to filter data based on user preferences.
* Identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels based on user preferences.
* Creating a travel route using Google Maps Directions API between the four citites as well as a marker layer map.

## Results:
My code below prompts users to enter weather preferences and based on which I generate a large database of cities to visit.

I could generate travel destinations across the world based on user preferences.

Finally I used Google Maps Directions API to give a travel route between four citites as well as a marker layer map
